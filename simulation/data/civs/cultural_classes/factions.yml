      wily Themistocles and extended 6 km from the city to the port of Piraeus.
      This secured the city's sea supply routes and prevented an enemy from
      starving out the city during a siege.

    history: >+
      Pericles (; Attic Greek: Περικλῆς Periklēs, pronounced [pe.ri.klɛ̂ːs] in
      Classical Attic; c. 495 – 429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek
      statesman, orator and general of Athens during its golden
      age,  specifically the time between the Persian and the Peloponnesian
      Wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and
      historically-influential Alcmaeonid family. Pericles had such a profound
      influence on Athenian society that he was acclaimed by Thucydides, a
      contemporary historian, as "the first citizen of Athens". Pericles turned
      the Delian League into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during
      the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he
      led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the "Age of
      Pericles", but the period thus denoted can include times as early as the
      Persian Wars or as late as the next century.

    emblem: ""
    history: "Iphicrates (Greek: Ιφικράτης) (c. 418 BC – c. 353 BC) was an Athenian
      general, who flourished in the earlier half of the 4th century BC. He is
      credited with important infantry reforms that revolutionized ancient Greek
      warfare by regularizing light-armed peltasts.Cornelius Nepos wrote that
      Iphicrates was such a leader, that he was not only comparable to the first
      commanders of his own time, but no one even of the older generals could be
      set above him. He had a deep knowledge of military tactics, he often had
      the command of armies and  he never miscarried in an undertaking by his
      own fault. He was always eminent for invention and excellence that he not
      only introduced much that was new into the military art, but made many
      improvements in what existed before."
