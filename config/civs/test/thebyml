  - Name: Thebans
    Description: The great power of Central Greece and leader of the Boeotian
      confederacy, Thebes is a force to be reckoned with. It is a major rival of
      ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion
      under Xerxes. Theban forces ended the power of Sparta at the Battle of
      Leuctra in 371 BC under the command of Epaminondas. The Sacred Band of
      Thebes (an elite military unit) famously fell at the battle of Chaeronea
      in 338 BC against Philip II and Alexander the Great. Prior to its
      destruction by Alexander in 335 BC, Thebes was a major force in Greek
      history, and was the most dominant city-state at the time of the
      Macedonian conquest of Greece.

      - Name: Oracle of Delphi.
        History: Historically, the Boeotians controlled the religiously important site
          of Delphi. The oracle at Delphi was the priestess of Apollo. She was
          tasked with uttering prophesies and answers to queries to the god.
          Delphi was the most sacred sanctuary in Greece and the 2nd oldest,
          Dodona in Epirus, dedicated to Zeus, being the oldest.

    Heroes:
      - Name: Epaminondas
        Class: Hero Spear Infantry
        Armament: Dory Spear
        Emblem: ""
        History: Leader, statesman, and general of the Boeotian city-state Thebes during
          its moment of ascendency during the middle decades of the 4th century
          BC.
      - Name: Pelopidas
        Class: Hero Sword Infantry
        Armament: Xiphos Short Sword
        Emblem: ""
        History: Pelopidas (died 364 BC) was an important Theban statesman and general
          in Greece. He led the Theban Sacred Band to defeat a much larger
          Spartan force early in his career. Later he accompanied his friend and
          co-Boeotarch, Epaminondas, in defeating the Spartans at the Battle of
          Leuktra using the novel Oblique Order phalanx formation, focusing
          their forces on one part of the Spartan line in order to break it and
          route the rest of the enemy army. At the end of his life, Pelopidas
          was called upon by the towns of Thessaly to protect them against the
          rising ambitions of Alexander of Pharae. He managed to defeat
          Alexander, but in his haste to strike the final blow on Alexander,
          Pelopidas was himself slain.
      - Name: Gorgidas
        Class: Hero Spear Infantry
        Armament: Dory Spear
        Emblem: ""
        History: Gorgidas was the first known Theban military leader of the Sacred Band
          of Thebes around 378 BC. Plutarch in his Life of Pelopidas credits
          Gorgidas with the creation of the Sacred Band, which he dispersed at
          first throughout the front ranks of the regular infantry, with the
          idea that they would inspire valour; however they were later arrayed
          by Pelopidas as a unit in order to make their gallantry more
          conspicuous.
CivBonuses:
  - Name: Oblique Order
    History: The oblique order is a military tactic whereby an attacking army
      focuses its forces to attack a single enemy flank. The force commander
      concentrates the majority of his strength on one flank and uses the
      remainder to fix the enemy line. This allows a commander with weaker or
      equal forces to achieve a local superiority in numbers. The commander can
      then try to defeat the enemy in detail. It has been used by numerous
      successful generals. Oblique order required disciplined troops able to
      execute complex maneuvers in varied circumstances. The first recorded use
      of this tactic was at the Battle of Leuctra, in Greece, when the Thebans
      under Epaminondas defeated the Spartans by highly enforcing one flank to
      fifty rows deep, rather than spread forces parsimoniously. Philip of
      Macedon learned Epaminondas' technique while held prisoner at Thebes, and
      his descendants, including Alexander the Great, used it in their
      campaigns. The classical writer Vegetius was the first known to write
      about the tactic that became known as the oblique order of battle.
