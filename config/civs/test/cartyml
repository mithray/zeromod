History: The Carthaginians have the largest roster of mercenary units in the
  game, and can train them from 3 different barracks called Embassies, but
  conversely have limited access to cheaper citizen soldiers. Their walls are
  very strong and so is their navy, with access to the Quinquereme heavy warship
  and a sea trading bonus. They begin a standard match with 1 free Numidian
  Cavalry.

  - Name: Carthaginians
    Description: Carthage, a city-state in modern-day Tunisia, was a formidable
      force in the western Mediterranean, eventually taking over much of North
      Africa and modern-day Spain in the third century B.C. The sailors of
      Carthage were among the fiercest contenders on the high seas, and masters
      of naval trade. They deployed towered War Elephants on the battlefield to
      fearsome effect, and had defensive walls so strong, they were never
      breached.
