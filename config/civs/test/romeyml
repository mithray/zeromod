          fight on. As a general he was immensely capable, standing alongside
          Scipio Africanus and Claudius Nero as the most effective Roman
          generals of the entire Second Punic War. In addition to his military
          achievements Marcellus was a fan of Greek culture and arts, which he
          enthusiastically promoted in Rome. He met his demise when his men were
          ambushed near Venusia. In honor of the respect the people held for

      fish scales."

    Class: ""
    Emblem: ""
    History: Sometimes it was a temporary camp built facing the route by which the
      army is to march, other times a defensive or offensive (for sieges)
      structure. Within the Praetorian gate, which should either front the east
      or the enemy, the tents of the first centuries or cohorts are pitched, and
      the dracos (ensigns of cohorts) and other ensigns planted. The Decumane
      gate is directly opposite to the Praetorian in the rear of the camp, and
      through this the soldiers are conducted to the place appointed for
      punishment or execution. It has a turf wall, and it's surrounded by a
      canal filled with water whenever possible for extra defense. Many towns
      started up as bigger military camps to evolve to more complicated cities.
