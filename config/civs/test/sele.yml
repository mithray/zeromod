  nearly every unit type available, including scythe chariots, armored war
  elephants, heavy pike infantry, and cataphracts. They quickly expand their
  territory with Military Colonies and have access to the Library, which boosts

  - Name: Seleucids
    Description: "The Seleucid Empire (Ancient Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Σελευκιδῶν,
      Basileía tōn Seleukidōn) was a Hellenistic state ruled by the
      Macedonian-Greek Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it
      was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian
      empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia
      and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's
      near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central
      Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait,
      Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan."

      - Name: Military Reforms
        History: Seleucid and indeed Successor warfare evolved over the course of the
          3rd and 2nd centuries. Contact with Eastern upstarts such as the
          Parthians and constant revolts of peripheral satrapies such as Bactria
          caused the Seleucids to reform their military and change their
          tactics, specifically in the cavalry arm. War with the Romans from the
          West and invasions from the Galatians also forced the Seleucids to
          reform their infantry regiments to be more flexible.
        Description: Traditional Army unlocks Silver Shield Pikemen and Scythed
          Chariots; Reform Army unlocks Romanized Heavy Swordsmen and
          Cataphracts.
      - Name: Epigamia Marriage Alliance
        History: Seleucus I Nicator invaded the Punjab region of India in 305 BC,
          confronting Chandragupta Maurya (Sandrokottos), founder of the Mauryan
          empire. It is said that Chandragupta fielded an army of 600,000 men
          and 9,000 war elephants (Pliny, Natural History VI, 22.4). Seleucus
          met with no success and to establish peace between the two great
          powers and to formalize their alliance, he married his daughter to
          Chandragupta. In return, Chandragupta gifted Seleucus a corps of 500
          war elephants, which would prove a decisive military asset for
          Seleucus as he fought the rest of Alexander's successors.
        Description: A one-time purchase of 20 Indian War Elephants from the Mauryan Empire.
      - Name: Parade of Daphne
        History: The Parade of Daphne was a strong show of force put on by the Seleucid
          king Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The grand procession mounted by the king
          was part of a festival of Apollo. The festival was celebrated before
          and after the reign of Antiochus, who merely increased its importance
          and size. Daphne then became a central cult place and oracle of the
          dynasty’s patron deity Apollo. In the parade, Polybius recounts, the
          Silver Shields regiment comprised of 5,000 men in their prime, armed
          in the 'Macedonian' manner, recruited from all reaches of the empire.
          Another 5,000 were armed in the 'Roman' manner with swords, chain
          armor, and oblong shields. This indicated that Antiochus may have
          planned to reform the entire Seleucid army along Roman lines. Included
          in the parade were 10,000 Gold Shield pikemen, 5,000 Bronze Shield
          pikemen, and 10,000 light infantry recruited from Arabia and
          Mesopotamia; 3,000 Thracians and 5,000 Galatians (Celts) recruited
          from West of the Taurus Mountains, an act in defiance of Rome. Cavalry
          included Eastern cavalry from Media and Persia, Companion cavalry,
          Nisean cavalry, the elite Agema cavalry, the heavily armored
          Cataphracts, and nearly 40 elephants, another contingent in direct
          violation of a treaty imposed by Rome upon the king's father,
          Antiochus III the Great.
        Description: Fortress units train very fast in batches.

        History: Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and
          persuasive in council, he (Seleucus) acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia,
          'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, Tapouria,
          Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been
          subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the
          boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia after that of
          Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to
          Seleucus. — Appian, 'The Syrian Wars'.

        Emblem: ""
        History: Antiochus inherited a troubled kingdom upon the beginning of his reign.
          From the verge of collapse he managed to weld back together the empire
          Seleukus I fought so hard to found. The rebellious eastern satraps of
          Bactria and Parthia were brought to heel , temporarily securing his
          eastern borders. He then turned his attention to mother Greece,
          attempting to fulfill the dreams of his fathers by invading Greece
          under the pretext of liberation. The Achaean League and the Kingdom of
          Pergamon banded together with the Romans to defeat him at the Battle
          of Magnesia, forever burying the dream of reuniting Alexander's
          empire.

        History: Antiochus IV Epiphanes was a son of Antiochus III the Great and brother
          of Seleucus IV Philopator. Originally named Mithridates, he assumed
          the name Antiochus either upon his accession to the throne or after
          the death of his elder brother Antiochus. Notable events during his
          reign include the near-conquest of Egypt (twice), which was halted by
          the threat of Roman intervention, and the beginning of the Jewish
          revolt of the Maccabees. He died of sudden illness while fighting off
          a Parthian invasion from the East.

  - Name: Military Colony
    Class: ""
    Emblem: ""
    History: The Seleucid kings invited Greeks, Macedonians, Galatians (Gauls),
      Cretans, and Thracians alike to settle in within the vast territories of
      the empire. They settled in military colonies called cleruchies
      (klēroukhia). Under this arrangement, the settlers were given a plot of
      land, or a kleros, and in return were required to serve in the great
      king's army when called to duty. This created a upper-middle class of
      military settlers who owed their livelihoods and fortunes to the Syrian
      kings and helped grow the available manpower for the imperial Seleucid
      army. A side effect of this system was that it drained the Greek homeland
      of military-aged men, a contributing factor to Greece's eventual conquest
      by Rome.

    Phase: Town
