  - Name: Han Dynasty
    Description: China is one of the world's oldest nations and remains one of the
      most powerful, dating back over 4,000 years to the present day. The
      origins of the empire derive from civilizations along the Yellow and
      Yangtze River valleys. Among the technological achievements of the Han
      Dynasty era that drive its reputation are the seismograph, medicinal
      innovations such as acupuncture and highly-disciplined educational
      institutions. However, perhaps the most memorable achievements of the
      ancient Chinese are architectural, notably the Terracotta Army and the

    Heroes:
      - Name: Liu Bang (Han Guazo)
        Class: Cavalry Hero
        Armament: Bronze Jian
        Emblem: ""
        History: Liu Bang was a peasant who joined a rebellion force to topple the Qin
          dynasty and due to the other leaders becoming overcontent and falling
          in battle, proceeded to become one of the rebellion leaders. Liu was
          no military genious but did know how do make use of good advisors and
          should become the first Emperor of the Han dynasty of unified China.
          During his reign he had to make up for the long period of wars and
          lowered taxes and encouraged agricultural growth to make the in the
          mountains and swamps hiding people return to their homeplace where
          they are registered for taxation. Wearing of silk clothes and the use
          of carts for travel was forbidden to traders to make all people take
          part in the rebuild of the economy. He made peace with the Xiongnu
          through marriage after he was decisively beaten and hopelessly
          encircled. As Liu Bang was of common origin and of few aristocratic
          knowledge, he followed his idiom that he had 'conquered the world on
          horseback and will also govern it from horseback', much to the outcry
          of some of his advisors.
      - Name: Wei Qing
        Class: Cavalry Hero
        Armament: Lian Nu
        Emblem: ""
        History: As a general of the Han Dynasty, Wei Qing is best acclaimed for his
          campaigns against Xiongnu, a confederation of nomadic tribes residing
          in northern China and Mongolia during the time period. In addition to
          his unmatched quality as a leader of men, he was a brilliant marksman
          and possessed remarkable horsemanship.
      - Name: Han Xin
        Class: Infantry Hero
        Armament: Qiang
        Emblem: ""
        History: "Han Xin was an able military general, recommended several times by
          Xiao He, a close advisor to Liu Bang, who finally served next to and
          under the much older Liu Bang, and is renowned as one of the Three
          Heroes of the early Han Dynasty due to conquering almost all of Liu's
          opponents. Many Chinese idioms originated from his specific warfare
          strategies. Thanks to Han Xin's brilliant flanking manuevers against
          Zhang Han, Han forces emerged victorious over the Three Qins in late
          BC 206. His 'attack from 10 sides' guerilla-like tactics during the
          decisive battle against the Chu general Xiang Yu, one of the most
          capable military leaders of the time, in BC 202 lead to the piecemeal
          and finally encirclement of the numerous Chu forces and to the Fall of
          Western Chu, unifying China for the second time. The careful Han Xin,
          though aware of being more and more mistrusted by Liu, who replaced
          all his kings, including Han Xin, by his own relatives over time, was
          finally accused of high treason due to the danger that emerged from
          his military genius and executed by being hung in a bell and being
          pierced by bamboo swords by Liu Bang's Empress and supposedly Xiao He
          in absence of Liu Bang. In an earlier trial Han Xin noted 'It is true
          when people say: The hunting dog becomes food as well after it is used
          to hunt game; a good bow is discarded when there are no birds left for
          shooting; an advisor dies after he helps his lord conquer a rival
          kingdom. Now that the empire is in place, I no longer serve any
          purpose!'. His last words - supposedly aged 31 - are supposed to be 'I
          regret not listening to Kuai Tong`s advice'. His wife and parents, and
          all of his clan was wiped out too by the power-hungry Liu."
