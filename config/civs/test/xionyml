History: The Xiongnu are a nomadic faction with cheap, weak buildings which can
  be packed and moved to new areas. Their Women are capable hunters and
  part-time soldiers, and their Men are strong raiders and looters and full-time
  warriors. They start each skirmish map with a free Yurt, which helps their
  starting population limit, a free Wagon, which is a mobile dropsite, and a
  Warlord, a powerful champion.
