auraName: Massed Pikes
auraDescription: Player and allied Pike Infantry boost each others' attack by
  +5% within 3 meters. This effect 'stacks', so that the more Pike Infantry
  fighting together en mass, the more effective this becomes (+10%, +15%, +20%
  etc.). Armor also increased +1 for all types.
