      - Name: Sevili Dusios
        History: The Celts, especially the Britons, took up the practice of either
          making permanent marks on their body in the form of tattoos or
          temporarily painted their bodies with woad paint. The effect could be
          very frightening for opponents.

      - Name: Carnutes
        History: The Carnutes were druids from Aulercia. They fought when needed, and
          were largely responsible for turning back the Belgae incursions into
          Armorica and Aulercia.
        Description: Gallic druids gain a small melee attack and don't run away when
          threatened.
      - Name: Soap Production
        History: The Celts were the first to invent soap as we know it. Despite their
          reputation among the more 'civilized' peoples in the South as savage
          barbarians, the Celts stressed hygiene, going so far as shaving their
          bodies to prevent fleas and other pests from taking root. Soap at this
          time was very acidic, only allowing people to bathe with it at most
          once per week.
        Description: All Human units +5% Health.
      - Name: Carnyx
        History: The carnyx was a type of trumpet with a loud droning sound used in

    Heroes:
      - Name: Viridomarus
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: When Celtic armies met the enemy, before the battle would start, the
          Celtic leader would go to the first line and challenge the bravest of
          the enemy warriors to a single combat. The story of how Marcus
          Claudius Marcellus killed a Gallic leader at Clastidium (222 B.C.) is
          typical of such encounters. Advancing with a small army, Marcellus met
          a combined force of Insubrian Gauls and Gaesatae at Clastidium. The
          Gallic army advanced with the usual rush and terrifying cries, and
          their king, Viridomarus, picking out Marcellus by means of his badges
          of rank, made for him, shouting a challenge and brandishing his spear.
          Viridomarus was an outstanding figure not only for his size but also
          for his adornments; for he was resplendent in bright colors and his
          armor shone with gold and silver. This armor, thought Marcellus, would
          be a fitting offering to the gods. He charged the Gaul, pierced his
          bright breastplate and cast him to the ground. It was an easy task to
          kill Viridomarus and strip him of his armor.
      - Name: Brennus
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: "Brennus is the name which the Roman historians give to the famous
          leader of the Gauls who took Rome in the time of Camillus. According
          to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the cleric who wrote “History of the Kings of
          Britain”, Brennus and his brother Belinus invaded Gaul and sacked Rome
          in 390 B.C., 'proving' that Britons had conquered Rome, the greatest
          civilization in the world, long before Rome conquered the Britons. We
          know from many ancient sources which predate Geoffrey that Rome was
          indeed sacked, but in 387 not 390, and that the raid was led by a man
          named Brennus, but he and his invading horde were Gallic Senones, not
          British. In this episode several features of Geoffrey's editing method
          can be seen: he modified the historical Brennus, created the brother
          Belinus, borrowed the Gallic invasion, but omitted the parts where the
          Celts seemed weak or foolish. His technique is both additive and
          subtractive. Like the tale of Trojan origin, the story of the sack of
          Rome is not pure fabrication; it is a creative rearrangement of the
          available facts, with details added as necessary. By virtue of their
          historical association, Beli and Bran are often muddled with the
          earlier brothers Belinus and Brennus (the sons of Dunvallo Molmutius)
          who contended for power in northern Britain in around 390 B.C., and
          were regarded as gods in old Celtic tradition."
      - Name: Vercingetorix
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: "Vercingetorix (Gaulish: Ver-Rix Cingetos) was the chieftain of the
          Arverni tribe in Gaul (modern France). Starting in 52 B.C. he led a
          revolt against the invading Romans under Julius Caesar. His actions
          during the revolt are remembered to this day. Vercingetorix was
          probably born near his tribes capital (Gergovia). From what little
          info we have Vercingetorix was probably born in 72 B.C., his father
          was Celtius and we don't know who his mother was. Because we only know
          of him from Roman sources we don't know much about Vercingetorix as a
          child or young man, except that perhaps he was probably very high
          spirited and probably gained some renown in deeds."
