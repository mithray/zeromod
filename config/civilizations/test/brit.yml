Factions:
  - Name: Britons
    Description: The Britons were the Celtic tribes of the British Isles. The Greeks
      called them the Prettanoi and the Romans called them Brittanni, but
      evidence suggests they called themselves the Pritani (or more likely they
      viewed themselves as members of their individual tribe rather than as
      citizens of a pan-Britannic culture). Using chariots and swift melee
      soldiers, they staged fearsome revolts against Rome to protect their
      customs and interests. Also, they built thousands of unique structures
      such as hill forts, crannogs, and towering brochs.
    Technologies:
      - Name: Woad Warriors
        History: The Celts, especially the Britons, took up the practice of either
          making permanent marks on their body in the form of tattoos or
          temporarily painted their bodies with woad paint. The effect could be
          very frightening for opponents.

      - Name: Great Tower
        History: The 'Great Towers' of Celtic legend had a basis in fact.

      - Name: Soap Production
        History: The Celts were the first to invent soap as we know it. Despite their
          reputation among the more 'civilized' peoples in the South as savage
          barbarians, the Celts stressed hygiene, going so far as shaving their
          bodies to prevent fleas and other pests from taking root. Soap at this
          time was very acidic, only allowing people to bathe with it at most
          once per week.

    Heroes:
      - Name: Caratacos
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: Caratacos's name is better known in its Romanized form, Caratacus.
          Under this name he is remembered as a fierce defender of Britain
          against the Romans after their invasion in 43 AD. Son of King Cynvelin
          of the Catuvellauni tribe, Caratacos fought for nine years against the
          Romans with little success, eventually fleeing to the tribes in Wales,
          where he was defeated decisively. Finally he entered Northern Britain,
          where was handed over to the Romans. Taken to Rome, Caratacos was
          allowed to live by the Emperor Claudius in contrary to Roman custom,
          which was to ritually strangle captured enemy leaders in the Roman
          Forum, a fate suffered by the Gallic leader Vercingetorix.
      - Name: Cunobelin
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: Cunobelin was a powerful ruler centered in the territory around modern
          day London. Ruling the Catuvellauni from Camulodunum, he was a warrior
          king who conquered a neighboring tribe and was referred to by the
          Romans as the King of the Britons. Eventually Cunobelin retired to
          become the arch-druid of Siluria, but was taken to Rome with his son
          upon Caratacos's capture. According to legend, the Apostle Paul
          baptized Cunobelin into Christianity before he died in Italy.
      - Name: Boudicca
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: Ammianus Marcellinus described how difficult it would be for a band of
          foreigners to deal with a Celt if he called in the help of his wife.
          For she was stronger than he was and could rain blows and kicks upon
          the assailants equal in force to the shots of a catapult. Boudicca,
          queen of the Iceni, was said to be 'very tall and terrifying in
          appearance; her voice was very harsh and a great mass of red hair fell
          over her shoulders. She wore a tunic of many colors over which a thick
          cloak was fastened by a brooch. Boudicca had actually at first been a
          Roman ally, along with her husband, Prasutagus, king of the Iceni.
          Prasutagus had been a close Roman ally after a brief uprising,
          respected as being forethinking even by his former enemies, now allied
          Romans, and free to rule his kingdom as their native tradition
          dictated, except in one case. Prasutagus, realizing he was going to
          die, agreed upon a will with his wife and subordinates; his daughters
          would inherit the physical running of the territory, under Boudicca's
          stewardship until they were adults, and the Emperor of Rome would have
          overlordship, collecting taxes and being allowed to request military
          aide. Much the same situation as he already held. The problem lay in
          that the Romans did not recognize female heirs, and thus asserted,
          upon Prasutagus's death, that only the Emperor's claim to the kingdom
          of Icenia was valid. They further noted it was regular Roman practice
          to only allow a client kingdom to be independent for the lifetime of
          the initial king, such as had occurred in Galatia. The Empire formally
          annexed the kingdom, and began extracting harsh taxes immediately,
          citing that Prasutagus was indebted to the Romans, having taken
          several loans during his lifetime that he had failed to repay.
          Boudicca's complaint about this treatment and the defiance of her
          deceased husband's will was met with brutality; Roman soldiers flogged
          her, and her daughters, only children, were raped. Boudicca and her
          subjects were infuriated at the disgrace done to their queen and the
          children. With the Roman governor of Britain engaged with the druids
          in Cambria, now Wales, Boudicca was able to attract more followers
          from outside the Iceni, as they were hardly the only British tribe
          growing rapidly disillusioned with the Romans. Boudicca and her army
          laid waste to three cities, routed a Roman legion, and called on the
          memory of Arminius, a German who had routed the Romans from his lands,
          and their own ancestors who had driven off Caesar near a century
          earlier. Boudicca was defeated by a major tactical blunder in the
          Battle of Watling Street, leading to much of her force being
          slaughtered as they could not withdraw to safety. Boudicca herself
          escaped, and then slew her daughters, and then herself, to avoid
          further shame at Roman hands.
