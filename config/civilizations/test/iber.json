  skirmishers and swordsmen and strong fortresses. Their Revered Monument boosts
  the attack of nearby soldiers and they can build blacksmiths in the village
  phase, earlier than most other factions.

  - Name: Iberians
    Description: The Iberians were a people of mysterious origins and language, with
      a strong tradition of horsemanship and metalworking. A relatively peaceful
      culture, they usually fought in other's battles only as mercenaries.
      However, they proved tenacious when Rome sought to take their land and
      freedom from them, and employed pioneering guerrilla tactics and flaming
      javelins as they fought back.

      - Name: Suzko Txabalina
        History: Iberian tribesmen were noted for wrapping bundles of grass about the
          shafts of their throwing spears, soaking that in some sort of
          flammable pitch, then setting it afire just before throwing. Fire was
          a constant danger in a crowded town or city, even during peace time.
          In a siege, an army would typically loose flaming projectiles (like
          arrows and javelins) over the enemy walls in a bid to set the enemy's
          buildings on fire.
        Description: Javelin infantry +10 crush attack (for a strong anti-building
          attack), but attack rate -50% slower and cost +10 wood.

    Heroes:
      - Name: Viriato
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: Viriato, like Vercingetorix amongst the Gauls, was the most famous of
          the Iberian tribal war leaders, having conducted at least 7 campaigns
          against the Romans in the southern half of the peninsula during the
          'Lusitani Wars' from 147-139 B.C. He surfaced as a survivor of the
          treacherous massacre of 9,000 men and the selling into slavery of
          21,000 elderly, women, and children of the Lusitani. They had signed a
          treaty of peace with the Romans, conducted by Servius Sulpicius Galba,
          governor of Hispania Ulterior, as the 'final solution' to the Lusitani
          problem. He emerged from humble beginnings in 151 B.C. to become war
          chief of the Lusitani. He was intelligent and a superior tactician,
          never really defeated in any encounter (though suffered losses in some
          requiring retreat). He succumbed instead to another treachery arranged
          by a later Roman commander, Q. Servilius Caepio, to have him
          assassinated by three comrades that were close to him.
      - Name: Caros
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: Caros was a chief of the Belli tribe located just east of the Celtiberi
          (Numantines at the center). Leading the confederated tribes of the
          meseta central (central upland plain) he concealed 20,000 foot and
          5,000 mounted troops along a densely wooded track. Q. Fulvius Nobilior
          neglected proper reconnaissance and lead his army into the trap strung
          out in a long column. Some 10,000 of 15,000 Roman legionaries fell in
          the massive ambush that was sprung upon them. The date was 23 August
          of 153 B.C., the day when Rome celebrated the feast of Vulcan. By
          later Senatorial Decree it was ever thereafter known as dies ater, a
          'sinister day', and Rome never again fought a battle on the 23rd of
          August. Caros was wounded in an after battle small cavalry action the
          same evening and soon died thereafter, but he had carried off one of
          the most humiliating defeats that Rome ever suffered.
      - Name: Indibil
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: Indibil was king of the Ilegetes, a large federation ranged principally
          along the Ebro River in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. During
          the Barcid expansion, from 212 B.C. he had initially been talked into
          allying himself with the Carthaginians who had taken control of a lot
          of territory to the south and west, however after loss and his capture
          in a major battle he was convinced, some say tricked, to switch to the
          Roman side by Scipio Africanus. But that alliance didn't last long, as
          Roman promises were hollow and the Romans acted more like conquerors
          than allies. So, while the Romans and their allies had ended
          Carthaginian presence in 'Hispania' in 206 B.C., Indibil and another
          tribal prince by the name of Mandonio, who may have been his brother,
          rose up in rebellion against the Romans. They were defeated in battle,
          but rose up in a 2nd even larger rebellion that had unified all the
          Ilergetes again in 205 B.C. Outnumbered and outarmed they were again
          defeated, Indibil losing his life in the final battle and Mandonio
          being captured then later put to death. From that date onward the
          Ilergetes remained a pacified tribe under Roman rule.
