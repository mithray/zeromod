    Heroes:
      - Name: Emperor Augustus
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: The first Roman emperor, though he always pretended to 'restore the
          Republic' even unto his death. Octavian, or 'Augustus', put an end to
          50 years of civil war and ushered in an era today we call 'Pax
          Romana,' or 'The Roman Peace', which lasted for over a century.
      - Name: Emperor Titus
        Class: ""
        Armament: ""
        Emblem: ""
        History: "Titus (Latin: Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus; 30 December
          39 â€“ 13 September 81) was Roman Emperor from 79 to 81. A member of the
          Flavian dynasty, Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death,
          thus becoming the first Roman Emperor to come to the throne after his
          own biological father. Prior to becoming Emperor, Titus gained renown
          as a military commander, serving under his father in Judaea during the
          First Jewish-Roman War. The campaign came to a brief halt with the
          death of emperor Nero in 68, launching Vespasian's bid for the
          imperial power during the Year of the Four Emperors. When Vespasian
          was declared Emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending
          the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he besieged and captured Jerusalem, and
          destroyed the city and the Second Temple. For this achievement Titus
          was awarded a triumph: the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory to
          this day. Under the rule of his father, Titus gained notoriety in Rome
          serving as prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and for carrying on a
          controversial relationship with the Jewish queen Berenice. Despite
          concerns over his character, Titus ruled to great acclaim following
          the death of Vespasian in 79, and was considered a good emperor by
          Suetonius and other contemporary historians. As emperor, he is best
          known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving
          the suffering caused by two disasters, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius
          in AD 79 and a fire in Rome in 80. After barely two years in office,
          Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was deified by the Roman
          Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian. (Wikipedia)"

    Class: ""
    Emblem: ""
    History: Sometimes it was a temporary camp built facing the route by which the
      army is to march, other times a defensive or offensive (for sieges)
      structure. Within the Praetorian gate, which should either front the east
      or the enemy, the tents of the first centuries or cohorts are pitched, and
      the dracos (ensigns of cohorts) and other ensigns planted. The Decumane
      gate is directly opposite to the Praetorian in the rear of the camp, and
      through this the soldiers are conducted to the place appointed for
      punishment or execution. It has a turf wall, and it's surrounded by a
      canal filled with water whenever possible for extra defense. Many towns
      started up as bigger military camps to evolve to more complicated cities.
