  - Name: Cleruchy
    History: .
    Description: This unlocks the Ptolemaic expansion building, the Klēroukhia or
      Military Colony, similar to Civic Centers for other factions. It is weaker
      and carries a smaller territory influence, but is cheaper and built
      faster.
  - Name: Mercenary Army
    History: The Greco-Macedonian Ptolemy Dynasty relied on large numbers of Greek
      and foreign mercenaries for the bulk of its military force, mainly because
      the loyalty of native Egyptian units was often suspect. Indeed, during one
      native uprising, Upper Egypt was lost to the Ptolemies for decades.
      Mercenaries were often battle-hardened and their loyalty can be bought,
      sometimes cheaply, sometimes not cheaply. This was of no matter, since
      Egypt under the Ptolemies was so prosperous as to be the richest of
      Alexander's successor states.
    Description: The Ptolemies can hire mercenaries instantly.
  - Name: Nile Delta
    History: If Egypt is the breadbasket of the Mediterranean, then the Nile Delta
      is the breadbasket of Egypt.

      Athens, Antioch, and Rome came to rely upon Egyptian grain in order to
      feed their masses.
    Description: Players allied with Egypt gain a free slow trickle of the food resource.
Structures:
  - Name: Military Colony
    Class: ""
    Emblem: structures/military_settlement.png
    History: The Ptolemaic kings invited Greeks, Macedonians, Galatians (Gauls),
      Cretans, and Thracians alike to settle in within the vast territories of
      the empire. They settled in military colonies called cleruchies
      (klēroukhia). Under this arrangement, the settlers were given a plot of
      land, or a kleros, and in return were required to serve in the great
      king's army when called to duty. This created a upper-middle class of
      military settlers who owed their livelihoods and fortunes to the Ptolemaic
      kings and helped grow the available manpower for the royal army. A side
      effect of this system was that it drained the Greek homeland of
      military-aged men, a contributing factor to Greece's eventual conquest by
      Rome.
