  - Name: Epirotes
    Description: Epirus was a Greek kingdom made famous by King Pyrrhus of Epirus
      (Pyrrhos ton Epeiros), when he took the offer from the Italian Greek city
      Tarentum (Taras) for help against the Romans. Epirus itself was a newly
      united state, formerly divided among the 3 chief tribes Chaonians,
      Thesprotians, and the powerful Molossians. Pyrrhos' uncle was Alexander I
      the Molossian, a contemporary of Alexander the Great, who, like Pyrrhos,
      also warred against the Romans. A few times the king of Epirus even
      managed to steal the throne of Macedonia for himself, once by Pyrrhos and
      once by his son Alexander II of Epirus. Later, Epirus founded itself as a
      federal democracy, but was broken up once the Romans warred with Macedon.

          known war dance of the Greeks. It was probably of Dorian origin and
          practiced at first solely as a training for war."

          family."

      - Name: Dodona, Oracle of Zeus
        History: "Dodona (Doric Greek: Δωδώνα, Ionic and Attic Greek: Δωδώνη) in Epirus
          in northwestern Greece was the oldest Hellenic oracle, possibly dating
          to the second millennium BCE according to Herodotus. The earliest
          accounts in Homer describe Dodona as an oracle of Zeus, and the
          attending priests and priestesses . Situated in a remote region away
          from the main Greek poleis, it was considered second only to the
          oracle of Delphi in prestige. Aristotle considered the region around
          Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes
          originated. The oracle was first under the control of the Thesprotians
          before it passed into the hands of the Molossians. It remained an
          important religious sanctuary until the rise of Christianity during
          the Late Roman era. During classical antiquity, according to various
          accounts, priestesses and priests in the sacred grove interpreted the
          rustling of the oak (or beech) leaves to determine the correct actions
          to be taken. According to a new interpretation, the oracular sound
          originated from bronze objects hanging from oak branches and sounded
          with the wind blowing, similar to a wind chime."

      - Name: Oracle of Hades and Persephone
        History: "The Nekromanteion (Greek: Νεκρομαντεῖον) was an ancient Greek temple
          of necromancy devoted to Hades and Persephone. According to tradition,
          it was located on the banks of the Acheron river in Epirus, near the
          ancient city of Ephyra. This site was believed by devotees to be the
          door to Hades, the realm of the dead. The site is at the meeting point
          of the Acheron, Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus rivers, believed to flow
          through and water the kingdom of Hades. The meaning of the names of
          the rivers has been interpreted to be 'joyless', 'burning coals' and
          'lament.' The word Necromanteion means 'Oracle of the Dead', and the
          faithful came here to talk with their dead ancestors. Although other
          ancient temples such as the Temple of Poseidon in Taenaron as well as
          those in Argolis, Cumae, and Herakleia in Pontos are known to have
          housed oracles of the dead, the Necromanteion of Ephyra was the most
          important. It belonged to the Thesprotians, the local Epirot Greek
          tribe. According to Herodotus' account, it was to the Necromanteion
          that Periander, the 6th century BC tyrant of Corinth, sent legates to
          ask questions of his dead wife, Melissa. In Homer's Odyssey, the
          Necromanteion was also described as the entrance by which Odysseus
          made his nekyia."

        History: As the son of Neoptolemus I and brother of Olympias, Alexander I was an
          uncle of Alexander the Great. He was also an uncle of Pyrrhus of
          Epirus. He was brought at an early age to the court of Philip II of
          Macedon, and after the Hellenic fashion became the object of his
          attachment. At the age of about 20, Philip made him king of Epirus,
          after dethroning his uncle Arymbas.In 334 BC, Alexander I, at the
          request of the Greek colony of Taras (in Magna Graecia), crossed over
          into Italy, to aid them in battle against several Italic tribes, the
          Lucanians and Bruttii. After a victory over the Samnites and Lucanians
          near Paestum, 332 BC, he made a treaty with the Romans. Success still
          followed his arms. He took Heraclea from the Lucanians, and Terina and
          Sipontum from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian
          exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in
          the battle of Pandosia and was killed by a Lucanian. He left a son,
          Neoptolemus, and a daughter, Cadmea.
      - Name: Pyrrhos A' Epeiros
        Class: ""

        Emblem: ""
        History: Pyrrhus (319/318–272 BC) was a Greek general and statesman of the
          Hellenistic period. He was king of the Greek tribe of Molossians, of
          the royal Aeacid house (from c. 297 BC), and later he became king of
          Epirus (r. 306–302, 297–272 BC) and Macedon (r. 288–284, 273–272 BC).
          He was one of the strongest opponents of early Rome. Some of his
          battles, though successful, caused him heavy losses, from which the
          term Pyrrhic victory was coined.

        History: Alexander II succeeded his father, Pyrrhus of Epirus, as king in 272
          BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with Antigonus II
          Gonatas, whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of Macedon. He
          was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by Demetrius II
          of Macedon, the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst
          the Acarnanians. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who
          entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It
          appears that he was in alliance with the Aetolians. Alexander married
          his paternal half-sister Olympias, by whom he had two sons, Pyrrhus,
          Ptolemy and a daughter, Phthia. On the death of Alexander, around 242
          BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married
          Phthia to Demetrius. There are extant silver and copper coins of this
          king. The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an
          elephant's head. The reverse represents Pallas holding a spear in one
          hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a
          thunderbolt.
