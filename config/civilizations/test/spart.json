Factions:
  - Name: Spartans
    Description: Sparta was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece, and its
      dominant military power on land from circa 650 B.C. Spartan culture was
      obsessed with military training and excellence, with rigorous training for
      boys beginning at age seven. Thanks to its military might, Sparta led a
      coalition of Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars, and won over
      Athens in the Peloponnesian Wars, though at great cost.
    Technologies:
      - Name: Feminine Mystique
        History: Spartan women were some of the freest in the ancient world. They could
          own land and slaves and even exercise naked like Spartan men. It is
          said that only Spartan women gave birth to real men. Such
          tough-as-nails women more than once helped save their city from
          disaster, for example when after a lost battle against Pyrrhus of
          Epirus they overnight built an earthen rampart to protect the city
          while their men slept in preparation for the next day's siege.
        Description: Spartan female citizens cannot be captured and will doggedly fight
          back against any attackers. They are also capable of constructing
          defense towers and palisades.
