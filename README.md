# Muse


The main goal of this project is to unify content from other mods and to make modding easier and more maintainable through reducing redundancy in Mod configuration. This is done by generating any redundant information in the necessary XML files from a smaller set of more human readable YAML configuration files. With redundancy removed, it's significantly easier to make changes to the game without spending nearly as much time editing XML files. With the time saved in editing XML files, artists and developers can save time in editing and maintaining files, and use that time to improve features and art, and doing historical research. With the game being easier to mod, improvements in one mod can more easily be carried over to other mods without needing to take the entire mod. The improvements will be treated modularly.

Once this project is finished, it should be easy to create a custom mod with different settings from other mods and civilization restrictions, such as including in the released mod only Baltic or Hellenic civilizations, or many other economic settings such as low armor, balancing adjustments etc.
